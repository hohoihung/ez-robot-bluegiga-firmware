  Welcome to the EZ-B v4 Embedded Web Server. This web interface allows you to configure the EZ-B v4's network settings. There are two ways to connect your device to the EZ-B v4 over Wi-Fi:<br />
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>1) Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) Mode:</b>
      The EZ-B v4 becomes a Wi-Fi Server which allows your device to connect to it. This is the default setting for the EZ-B v4. In this mode, your device (<i>i.e. Computer, iPad, iPhone, etc.</i>) will connect directly to the EZ-B v4 over its Wi-Fi network. You will lose access to the internet if connected this way, unless your device has two network adapters.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <b>
        2) Wi-Fi Client Mode:
      </b> The EZ-B v4 will join your existing Wi-Fi network as a client. When the EZ-B v4 is connected to your Wi-Fi network, you may not know the IP Address that it is assigned. The EZ-Builder software includes a network scan tool which will find all EZ-B v4's on your network.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>*Note:</b> To reset the EZ-B v4 to default network settings, use a paperclip to press the reset button located on the top of the EZ-B v4 while powered.<br />
